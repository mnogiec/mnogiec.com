I warmly think back to my childhood when I edited the first file containing code, just because I wanted to personalize a game server for me and my friends. Throughout the following years I've gained experience in multiple fields of programming. I can proudly say, that it's not only my way to make a living, but also my huge passion. Many projects that I have participated in needed direct communication with clients and managing a team just by myself. I hope we will have an opportunity to work together soon!"
